# Overview

The library relies on a set of structured databases to support a wide variety of Telltale games. Each game is treated as an independent entry, enabling easy extension and maintenance. The databases are intended for use by both the library and community contributors who wish to add or improve support for games.

## Database Categories

There are three main categories of databases:

1. **Game Descriptors**  
   - **Purpose:** Defines general configuration for each supported game.
   - **Format:** JSON file (extension: `.json`)
   - **Aliases:** Game snapshots, game configurations.

2. **Version Databases**  
   - **Purpose:** Describes metaclass descriptions for a given game.
   - **Format:** JSON file (extension: `.vdb.json`)
   - **Aliases:** Metaclass description databases.
   - **Note:** Version databases **require a game descriptor to function with the same slug**.

3. **Hash Database(s)** (Planned/Experimental)  
   - **Purpose:** Contains SQLite databases with file hashes unique to each game.
   - **Format:** SQLite database file (extension: `.db`)
   - **Aliases:**
   - **Note:** Do not try to implement any hash databases on your own as of now.

## File Naming & Standards

For consistency, all database file names are in slug form with the appropriate extension:

```
[slug-title]-[year]-[month]-[platform]-[demo]
```
- **slug-title:** The full name of the game in slug form.
- **year/month:** Release date of the game (e.g., `2012` or `2016-01`).
- **platform:** If applicable, a platform tag (e.g., `xbox360`).
- **demo:** If applicable and the game itself was a demo, a demo tag (e.g., `demo`).

**Examples:**
- `the-walking-dead-2012.json`
- `the-wolf-among-us-2013.vdb.json`

## Game Descriptor Fields

| Field                    | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Example                                       |

| `IsTtarch2`              | `bool`               | Whether the game uses the TTArch2 archive format (`true` for TTArch2, `false` for TTArch).                                                                                                     | `true`                                        |
| `TtarchVersion`          | `int`                | The version of the archive format used by the game. If `IsTtarch2` is true, use versions 2-4, otherwise - versions 0-9.                                                                        | `3`                                           |
| `LuaVersion`             | `string`             | Lua scripting engine version used by the game. It can be either `5.0.2`, `5.1.2` or `5.2.3`.                                                                                                   | `"5.1.2"` or `"5.1"`                          |

| `AreSymbolsHashed`       | `bool`               | Whether the game's symbols are hashed (`true` or `false`). This should almost always be `true`. Only `MBIN` are allowed to not be hashed.                                                      | `true`                                        |

## FAQ

**Q:** Why are there three types of databases?  
**A:** To separate general game configuration, version-specific metadata, and hash-related data, making the toolkit more extensible and maintainable.

**Q:** Can I use these databases in my own tools?  
**A:** Absolutely! All databases are open for community use and extension.

**Q:** What is a "slug title/text"?  
**A:** Descriptive text, which is in lowercase, has spaces replaced with hyphens, and has
special characters removed (e.g., "The Walking Dead: Season 2" → `the-walking-dead-season-2`).
